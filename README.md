### Introduction

- I have predicted whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features provided in the famous Pima Indians Diabetes dataset by developing machine learning model.
- I have done model building, finding best model, cross validation to ensure model is not overfitting and feature selection.
- Finally I have obtained best model (SVM) with an accuracy of 75% and this model was able to predict whether patient has diabetes or not.
